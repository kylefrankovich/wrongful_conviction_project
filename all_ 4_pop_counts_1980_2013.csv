Several adjustments have been made to prevent the double counting of individuals with dual correctional population status: starting in 1998, probationers who were incarcerated in jail or prison were removed from the total correctional population count; starting in 1999, prisoners housed in local jails were removed from the total incarcerated and total correctional population counts; starting in 2005, parolees who were incarcerated in jail or prison were excluded from the total correctional population count; and starting in 2008, parolees who were also on probation were removed from the total correctional population count.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
